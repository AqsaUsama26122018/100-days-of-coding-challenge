//MORE CONDITIONAL TESTS:
//You don't have to limit the number of tests you create to 10.
//If you want to try more comparasions,write  more tests.Have atleast one true and one false results for each of the 
//following:
//Test for equality and inequality with strings.
//Test using the lower case function.
//Numerical test involving equality and inequality,greater than and less than,greater than or equal to 
//and less than or equal to.
//Tests using "and" and "or" operators.
//Test wheter an item is un an array.
//test wheter an item is not in an array.

//ANSWER:

//Creating  variable:
//let apple = "apple";

//Test for equality and inequality:
//EQUALITY TEST:
//console.log("apple is equal to apple");
//console.log(apple =="apple");


//INEQUALITY TEST:
//console.log("apple is not equal to apple");
//console.log(apple != "apple");

//Test using lower case Function:
//let uppercaseApple ="APPLE";
//console.log("APPLE is equal to apple after converting to lowercase");
//console.log(uppercaseApple.toLocaleLowerCase() == "apple");

//console.log("APPLE is not equal to apple after converting to lowercase");
//console.log(uppercaseApple.toLocaleLowerCase() != "apple");

//Numerical tests involvin equality and inequality, greater than and less than,
//greater than or equal to or less than equal to:

 //let ten = 10;
 //let twenty = 20;

 //ERqual to:
 //console.log("ten is equal to twenty");
 //console.log(ten == twenty);

 //Not Equal to:
 //console.log("ten is not equal to twenty");
 //console.log(ten != twenty);

 //Greater than:
 //console.log("twenty is greater than ten");
 //console.log(twenty > ten);

 //less than:
 //console.log("twenty is less than ten");
 //console.log(twenty < ten);

 //Greater than or equal to:
 //console.log("twenty is greater than or equal to ten");
 //console.log(twenty >= ten);

 //less than or equal to:
 //console.log("twenty is less than or equal to ten");
 //console.log(twenty <= ten);

 //TEST USING "AND" AND "OR" OPERATORS:

 //USING && (AND):
 //console.log("twenty is not equal to ten and twenty is greater than ten");
 //console.log(twenty != ten && twenty> ten );

// console.log("twenty is not equal to ten and ten is greater than twenty");
 //console.log(twenty != ten && ten > twenty);

 //USING || (OR )OPERATORS:
// console.log("twenty is greater than ten or twenty is equal to twenty");
 //console.log(twenty > ten || twenty == twenty);

 //console.log("twenty is less than ten or twenty is not equal to twenty");
 //console.log(twenty < ten || twenty != twenty);

 //Teat WHETHER AN ITEM IS PRESENT IN AN ARRAY :
 let fruits =["apple","orange",'banana']
 console.log("If apple  is in fruits?predict true ")
 console.log("apple in fruits");
 
 
 //TEST WHETHER AN ITEM IS NOT IN AN ARRAY:
 console.log("Is peach in fruits?predict false");
 console.log("peach in fruits");
